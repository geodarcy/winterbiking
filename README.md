VGI winter biking conditions map

The intention of this map is to collect current cycling condition. While is does start zoomed in on Edmonton, Alberta, data can be entered anywhere.

Currently, data are read from and written to a geoJSON text. This needs to be changed to either use my CartoDB account or a mySQL database.
