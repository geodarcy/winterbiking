NewComment
a huge barrier to active transport south of the river is nonexistence of east west connectors. developing real east west connectors should be the highest prirority. To enable this, and to develop the former CN yards into an urban oasis, suggest building bicycle overpass(es) over calgary trail

As stated, this should be developed as multi-use, NO cars.  Turning it into a road (if the rail lines get removed) would be a disaster for all the adjacent 76th ave neighbourhoods. 76th Ave would rival Whyte as a shortcut from Sherwood Park to the University, increasing the flow greatly.
